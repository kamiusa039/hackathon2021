# Obj-C

Objective-C is the primary programming language you use when writing software for OS X and iOS. It is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. Objective-C inherits the syntax, primitive types, and flow control statements of C and adds syntax for defining classes and methods. It also adds language-level support for object graph management and object literals while providing dynamic typing and binding, deferring many responsibilities until runtime.

## What is Obj-C used for?

Objective-C is one of the main programming languages used by Apple for the iOS system and can be used to create mobile applications for this specific platform.

    	NSLog(@"Hello, World!");
