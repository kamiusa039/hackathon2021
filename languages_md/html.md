# HTML / CSS

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) gives content structure and meaning by defining the content in certain categories. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a presentation language to style the appearance of the content. While extremely interlinked, these two languages are independent of each other - CSS should not be written inside of a HTML document and vice versa. HTML will always represent content, and CSS will always represent the appearance of said content. These are two of the most dominant computer languages available.

## What is HTML / CSS used for?

If you’re thinking of building a website, then you’ll almost certainly have come across the acronyms HTML and CSS. These two essential tools form some of the foundations of any webpage. HTML is supported by every single browser and is established on pretty much every webpage in existence. You don’t need any licenses, you don’t need to pay for it, and it can be pretty easy to learn and code. If we can compare a webpage to the human body, then HTML is the bones of the body.  

If HTML is the bones of the body, then CSS is the skin that covers it. It’s used for background colour, styling, layout, borders, shadowing – all the essential design bits and bobs that make a webpage look slick and smart. CSS enables you to distinguish between presentation and content by modifying the design and display of HTML elements.
