# C

C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software such as operating systems, databases and compilers. C is an excellent language to learn for beginners as it builds the foundational understanding and knowledge of coding that is essential in higher-level languages. It is a structured language that produces efficient programs and can be compiled on a variety of operating systems. 

## What is C used for?

C was designed for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. It was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C are language compilers, text editors, network drivers and language interpreters.
