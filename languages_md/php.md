# PHP

PHP is a widely used, open-source scripting language geared towards web development. Primarily an object-oriented language, it is used to develop websites or web applications, and can only be interpreted on a server that has PHP installed. Accessing PHP scripts from a client computer requires only a web browser. In addition, it can be embedded into HTML, making it an extremely versatile language.

## What is PHP used for?

PHP is used on popular sites such as Facebook, Wordpress and Wikipedia. It has a short learning curve and is supported by almost all hosting servers - a downside is that a hosting server is needed to run a PHP script. It can perform system functions (eg. reading, writing and closing files), forms (eg. gather data from files, save data to a file) and encrypt data. It is an extremely practical coding language, with a focus on five core tenets - simplicity, efficiency, security, flexibility and familiarity.
