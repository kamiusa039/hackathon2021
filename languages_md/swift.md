# Swift

Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community. Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple's earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift works with Apple's *Cocoa* and *Cocoa Touch* frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift's design was the ability to interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades.

## What is Swift used for?

Swift code almost mirrors natural English, in addition to other contemporary programming languages. This readability makes it simpler for existing programmers from JavaScript, Java, Python, C#, and C++ to embrace Swift into their toolchain, especially when transitioning to the Apple OS. Learning Swift is a great introduction to modern programming concepts and best practices. Swift makes it easy to write software that is incredibly fast and safe by design. 

## Hello, World! [ hello_world.swift ]

	print("Hello, World!")
