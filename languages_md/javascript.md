# JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting language that allow you to implement complex features on web pages. It is a text-based language that is used both client-side and server-side that to add behaviour to web pages. While other languages (HTML and CSS) are used to give structure and style to a web page, JavaScript is responsible for engaging the user with its interactive elements. Incorporating JavaScript improves the user experience by converting a web page from static to interactive.

Frameworks for JavaScript such as *React*, *React Native*, *Angular* and *Vue* can be used to develop mobile apps.
