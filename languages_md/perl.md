# Perl

Perl is not a programming language by itself, but rather a group of programming languages which are interpreted and dynamic. The family includes Perl 5 and Perl 6 and development of both languages take place independent of each other. It combines the features of languages like C and shellscript, and is extremely versatile. Perl has seen a decline of users as Python has gained popularity, as the flexibility of Perl can be confusing for newer programmers, while remaining relevant for power users.

## What is Perl used for?

Perl is more powerful language than similar ones, and is also fast. As it was designed for text processing, with in-built text processing capability, Perl is widely used in server-side programming. Web developers use Perl for both text processing and manipulation. Perl has had roles in leading research in areas such as genomics and remains an integral part of database integration, such as *MySQL* and *ORACLE*.
