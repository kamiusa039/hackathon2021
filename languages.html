<p>JavaScript is a scripting language that allow you to implement complex features on web pages. It is a text-based language that is used both client-side and server-side that to add behaviour to web pages. While other languages (HTML and CSS) are used to give structure and style to a web page, JavaScript is responsible for engaging the user with its interactive elements. Incorporating JavaScript improves the user experience by converting a web page from static to interactive. </p>

<p>JavaScript is mainly used for web-based applications and browsers. However, it is used beyond just the web, taking roles in servers and embedded hardware controls. Frameworks for JavaScript such as <em>React</em>, <em>React Native</em>, <em>Angular</em> and <em>Vue</em> can be used to develop mobile apps. There are a number of highly popular applications that use the JavaScript framework <em>Node.js</em>, including PayPal, LinkedIn, Netflix and Uber!</p>

<p>Java is an all-around universal programming language. It is a an object-oriented programming language that has a variety of applications, and is constantly evolving, almost uniquely combining innovation with stability. Java can be used to create complete applications that can run on a single computer or be distributed across servers and clients in a network. The language has an English-like syntax with minimum special characters, and could be learned in a short time span and used to build suitable applications.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-java-used-for-">What is Java used for?</h2>
<p>Java derives its popularity from its independence, only requiring a Java Runtime Environment to be installed, regardless of operating system. Common uses of Java include Desktop GUI applications, Android apps, science and research and financial and retail services.

<p>C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software such as operating systems, databases and compilers. C is an excellent language to learn for beginners as it builds the foundational understanding and knowledge of coding that is essential in higher-level languages. It is a structured language that produces efficient programs and can be compiled on a variety of operating systems. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-c-used-for-">What is C used for?</h2>
<p>C was designed for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. It was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C are language compilers, text editors, network drivers and language interpreters.</p>

</code></pre><h1 id="assembly">Assembly</h1>
<p>Assembly is any low-level programming language that is intended to communicate directly with a computer&#39;s hardware. Processors in machines only understand machine language instructions, which are known as Binary. However, this language is too obscure and complex for use in software development. As such, Assembly represents the various machine language instructions in symbolic code and adds a more understandable format. It is specific to a particular computer architecture in contrast to high-level programming languages, which are generally portable across multiple systems.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-assembly-used-for-">What is Assembly used for?</h2>
<p>Assembly decreases the execution time and memory load on any processor, and having an understanding of the language tends to increase the understanding of how programs interface with the operating system, processor and BIOS. In addition, Assembly improves one&#39;s awareness of how data is represented and is the most suitable for time-critical jobs. </p>

<p>Perl is not a programming language by itself, but rather a group of programming languages which are interpreted and dynamic. The family includes Perl 5 and Perl 6 and development of both languages take place independent of each other. It combines the features of languages like C and shellscript, and is extremely versatile. Perl has seen a decline of users as Python has gained popularity, as the flexibility of Perl can be confusing for newer programmers, while remaining relevant for power users.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-perl-used-for-">What is Perl used for?</h2>
<p>Perl is more powerful language than similar ones, and is also fast. As it was designed for text processing, with in-built text processing capability, Perl is widely used in server-side programming. Web developers use Perl for both text processing and manipulation.

<p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) gives content structure and meaning by defining the content in certain categories. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a presentation language to style the appearance of the content. While extremely interlinked, these two languages are independent of each other - CSS should not be written inside of a HTML document and vice versa. HTML will always represent content, and CSS will always represent the appearance of said content. These are two of the most dominant computer languages available.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-html-css-used-for-">What is HTML / CSS used for?</h2>
<p>If you’re thinking of building a website, then you’ll almost certainly have come across the acronyms HTML and CSS. These two essential tools form some of the foundations of any webpage. HTML is supported by every single browser and is established on pretty much every webpage in existence. You don’t need any licenses, you don’t need to pay for it, and it can be pretty easy to learn and code. If we can compare a webpage to the human body, then HTML is the bones of the body.  </p>
<p>If HTML is the bones of the body, then CSS is the skin that covers it. It’s used for background colour, styling, layout, borders, shadowing – all the essential design bits and bobs that make a webpage look slick and smart. CSS enables you to distinguish between presentation and content by modifying the design and display of HTML elements.</p>

<p>For those who are new to coding and programming, Python can be an excellent first step. Python is one of the simplest programming languages in the best way possible. It’s relatively easy to learn, making it a great way to start building your programming knowledge. As it is an high-level language, it is relatively easy to read and understand, as its syntax is more like English. Its straightforward layout means that you can work out what each line of code is doing. As it’s an open-source language, anyone can use Python to code. What’s more, there is a community that supports and develops the ecosystem, adding their own contributions and libraries. </p>

Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple&#39;s earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift works with Apple&#39;s <em>Cocoa</em> and <em>Cocoa Touch</em> frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift&#39;s design was the ability to interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-swift-used-for-">What is Swift used for?</h2>
<p>Swift code almost mirrors natural English, in addition to other contemporary programming languages. This readability makes it simpler for existing programmers from JavaScript, Java, Python, C#, and C++ to embrace Swift into their toolchain, especially when transitioning to the Apple OS. Learning Swift is a great introduction to modern programming concepts and best practices. Swift makes it easy to write software that is incredibly fast and safe by design. </p>
