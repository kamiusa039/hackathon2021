## Upskilling students - Soft skills

### Summary
We believe that the formalised education system does not adequately equip students with the necessary life skills, resulting in an inequitable system that disadvantages a significant portion of the student population. We aim to tailor improvements towards highschool students. As such, this project aims to supplement the formalised education system by developing a database of easily accessible knowledge that ultimately improves the overall effectiveness of the education system by developing necessary soft skills.

Our team will implement this through the development of a HTML web-app that combines multimedia articles with discussion forums. It will also consist of an interactive component, with activities to test learning and understanding, with provided feedback through forums.

### Implementation
We will develop a web-app in Python, C and HTML, with the use of phpBB as our primary forum software. We will supplement this by developing a database in Python to house our user information and use Twilio API to verify accounts and establish 2FA. C will be used as the primary coding language.
